=======
The idea behind this package is to give the user control over the stop-word 
selection. The core \code{generate_stoplist} function relies on 
\code{multilingual_stopwords}, a large data frame derived from the current 
release of the Universal Dependencies Treebanks. We have included all languages 
whose corpora totalled above 10,000 tokens -- large enough to cover all common 
closed-class words, such as prepositions, conjunctions, and auxiliary verbs.
The data comes encoded in UTF-8.
